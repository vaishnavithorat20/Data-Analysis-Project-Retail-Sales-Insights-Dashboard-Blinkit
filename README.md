# Data-Analysis-Project-Retail-Sales-Insights-Dashboard-Blinkit

I'm excited to share my latest data analysis project where I explored a retail dataset inspired by platforms like Blinkit â€“ India's last-minute delivery app.

Using Python for data preprocessing and analysis, and MS SQL for structured querying, I built this interactive dashboard to uncover key business insights such as:

âœ… Total Sales & Average Ratings
âœ… Product Category & Fat Content Breakdown
âœ… Outlet Size, Location & Year-wise Trends
âœ… Performance by Supermarket Tier

ðŸ”§ Tech Stack:

Python (Pandas, Matplotlib/Seaborn)

MS SQL Server

Power BI (for dashboard visualization)

ðŸ“Œ This project helped me strengthen my skills in:

Data Cleaning & Transformation

SQL Query Optimization

Business Intelligence & Storytelling with Data

ðŸ’¡ Inspired by real-world problem statements from industry leaders like @Accenture and @Capgemini who continue to lead in the field of digital and data innovation!
